# MNIST_Image_Classification
This project implements and compares **classical machine learning algorithms** for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It explores how different models—**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and a **Linear Classifier**—perform on the same data under different training strategies..
